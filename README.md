# Vehicle detection

(Udacity reviewers, check out [my writeup](./WRITEUP_TIRILA_JM.md))

## General info

This repository will contain all my work for the Udacity CarND Term1 final project.

Note on code copyright: Even though the overall structure and also much of the details will be written by me, much 
of the credit goes to the Udacity team. I'm not aware of any licensing aspects, please contact me if you need some
info on this.

## The project

The instructions for the vehicle detection project are part of the CarND program and are not reproduced here. 
The general framework may be obvious from the writeout that will be included in this repo once the project is ready, but 
I can give no guarantee on whether the code or the writeup will be useful to anyone outside of the CardND context. 

## Further instructions

Should any further info be needed, contact me and I'll try to provide it. You 
can also refer to the writeup below as it lists e.g. instructions on how to run the code. 

## The writeup

Udacity people, look this way please. My written report can be found by following [this link](./WRITEUP_TIRILA_JM.md).
