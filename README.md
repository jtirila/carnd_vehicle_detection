# Vehicle detection

## General info

This repository will contain all my work for the Udacity CarND Term1 final project.

As of now (7 June 2017), this is heavily work in progress but I hope to get something reasonable running in about 
a week. 

Note on code copyright: Even though the overall structure and also much of the details will be written by me, much 
of the credit goes to the Udacity team. I'm not aware of any licensing aspects, please contact me if you need some
info on this.

## The project

The instructions for the vehicle detection project are part of the CarND program and are not reproduced here. 
The general framwork may be obvious from the writeout that will be included in this repo once the project is ready, but 
I can give no guarantee on whether the code or the writeup will be useful to anyone outside of the CardND context. 

## The structure of the code and running the pipeline

### Prerequisities

TODO: this is WIP. You will need at least
* All the Python packages needed to run the code. The easisest way is probably to install the Udacity started kit. 
* A suitable set of training images to train the vehicle detection classifier. These files will not be included in the 
  repository
* The project video is also omitted. You should find it or an equivalent video. Probably there are some requirements 
  on the type of video but I don't know them as of now. 

TODO, the following is just a speculative example: 

```python
from carnd_vehicle_detection.detect_vehicles import detect_vehicles
detect_vehicles
```

## The writeup

(Note: no point following the link just yet.)

Udacity people, look this way please. My written report can be found by following [this link](./WRITEUP_TIRILA_JM.md).
