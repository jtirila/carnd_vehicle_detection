# Checklist

This is my personal checklist to remember to do certain things before submitting the project.

* [ ] The README is OK and the writeup easy to find by reviewers
* [ ] All the necessary files to run the code are included 
* [ ] Some instructions on installing the packages is added to the README 
* [ ] All important code is well documented
* [ ] The code structure (directory hierarchy etc.) makes sense and naming is OK
* [ ] Just for the sake of it, there are at least a couple of unit tests
* [ ] Any files need to be renamed, for example if there are any requirements on the output video name?
* [ ] The repository structure tree in the writeup has been update to match the code?
